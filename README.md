# SQL Queries for Sales and Customer Analysis

## **Project Overview**

In this project, I developed and executed a series of SQL queries to analyze sales, customer behavior, and product performance data. The goal was to derive actionable insights by querying a database and answering key business questions, such as customer retention, sales trends, and revenue distribution across different categories and sellers.

## **Problem Statement**

The problem was to gain a deeper understanding of the sales and customer data to help the business make informed decisions. The challenges included:

- Analyzing large volumes of transactional data efficiently.
- Identifying key trends and patterns in sales and customer behavior.
- Understanding factors that drive revenue and how they relate to customer purchases.
- Providing insights on customer retention and product performance.

## **Solution**

To address the problem, I designed a series of SQL queries across various levels of complexity:

### **Basic Queries**
1. **Unique Cities of Customers**: Identified all distinct cities where customers are located.
2. **Orders in 2017**: Counted how many orders were placed in 2017.
3. **Total Sales per Category**: Calculated the total sales for each product category.
4. **Orders Paid in Installments**: Calculated the percentage of orders paid in installments.
5. **Customers by State**: Counted the number of customers from each state.

### **Intermediate Queries**
1. **Orders per Month in 2018**: Counted the number of orders placed each month in 2018.
2. **Average Products per Order by City**: Calculated the average number of products per order, grouped by city.
3. **Revenue by Product Category**: Calculated the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
4. **Correlation between Product Price and Purchases**: Identified the correlation between product price and the number of purchases.
5. **Total Revenue by Seller**: Calculated the total revenue generated by each seller, ranking them by revenue.

### **Advanced Queries**
1. **Moving Average of Order Values**: Calculated the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
2. **Cumulative Sales per Month**: Calculated the cumulative sales per month for each year.
3. **Year-over-Year Sales Growth**: Calculated the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
4. **Customer Retention Rate**: Calculated the retention rate, based on customers who made a second purchase within 6 months.
5. **Top 3 Customers by Yearly Spend**: Identified the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.

The queries were executed using SQL, and Python (via Pandas and NumPy) was used to calculate correlations and visualize results where needed.

## **Key Insights**

From the executed queries, several key insights emerged:

1. **Geographic Distribution of Customers**: Certain cities and states were found to have higher concentrations of customers, providing potential areas for targeted marketing campaigns.
2. **Sales Trends**: There was a noticeable seasonal trend in the number of orders placed, with peaks during specific months, helping the business plan for inventory and promotional activities.
3. **Product Category Performance**: Some product categories contributed significantly more to the total revenue than others, indicating which categories could benefit from increased focus or marketing efforts.
4. **Customer Retention**: A high percentage of customers made repeat purchases within 6 months, suggesting that retention strategies (e.g., loyalty programs) could further increase sales.
5. **Revenue by Seller**: Certain sellers were driving much higher revenue than others, indicating a need for performance review and potential seller-specific strategies.
6. **Growth Metrics**: The year-over-year growth rate of total sales showed a positive trend, indicating healthy business growth. However, areas with lower growth may need targeted efforts.

## **Technologies Used**

- **SQL**: Used to query and extract insights from the database.
- **Python**: Utilized for data manipulation and calculating statistical correlations.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Used for further analysis and calculations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Employed for running SQL queries and analyzing data.

## **Future Work and Improvements**

While the analysis provided valuable insights, future improvements could include:

- **Further Segmentation**: Analyzing customer behavior by segments (e.g., demographics, purchase history) for more granular insights.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Implementing machine learning models to predict customer churn, sales trends, and product demand.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Integrating real-time data feeds to provide up-to-date insights on sales and customer activity.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how data analysis, specifically through SQL queries, can uncover valuable insights that inform business decisions. By understanding customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance, businesses can optimize operations, marketing, and sales strategies to drive growth.
